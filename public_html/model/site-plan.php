<h2>Personas:</h2>
<ul>
<li>John: John is a high school student just discovering the world of super heroes as all these big movies come out. 
He wants to find a comprehensive list of all the movies that link together so he can watch them all and be more fully 
aware of what’s going on in the cinematic universe. Imagine his excitement when he finds the trailers, summaries, and 
background stories on my page. Now he knows exactly what he wants to watch, or at least has an idea of what he missed 
if he doesn’t have time or money to watch each one. He also has a good idea now of where he can start if he wants to start 
a comic book collection. The comics for the movies that haven’t come out yet will be worth a lot more once the movies come 
out, so he can get ahead of the game with some of the series that aren’t coming out for at least a couple of years. </li>

<li>Lucy: Lucy is a busy young wife and mother, still getting the hang of both. She has a couple hours to kill during nap 
time sometimes after her chores are done, or when she simply wants to procrastinate and take a break from chores. Her husband 
is a comic book collector and fan, obsessed with all things Marvel, so she wants to start learning more about the Marvel Universe 
so she can better understand what he’s talking about and share a hobby together. (Isn’t she sweet?) She stumbles onto our site 
with her limited computer skills and discovers not only trailers and summaries to most of the major Marvel movies, but also the 
background stories and cover pages behind those movies. Now she can have more educated conversations with her sweet, excited nerd 
of a husband about what Iron man originally looked like, the plot of the Avengers, the fact that a character called She-Hulk even 
exists! Needless to say, she’s also excited to learn that there are more female heroes than she knew about, too. </li>
